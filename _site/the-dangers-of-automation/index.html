				<p>Software automates, which can save us time, money and tedium. We have software that loops through library data, prints a list of all the branches and generates a web page for each one displaying its address, opening hours and events. If we had to do this manually it’d be a full time job (and a boring one at that).</p>

<p>However, we fear the machines taking over in the future, the power of the algorithm. But the dangers don’t just lie in underemployment or the future: automating the wrong things is already causing more complex problems. The mess that newspapers have got themselves in over advertising and performance are down to offloading their advertising to some machine somewhere or other:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But when publishers don’t sell ads themselves, they use third-party services to fill those remaining spots. Third-party services use an automated bidding system to match ads with websites, based on whom advertisers want to reach, which audiences different publishers serve, and what rates both parties are willing to accept. Advertisers can target increasingly specific user profiles based on information collected through cookies placed on a user’s computer. <cite><a href="http://niemanreports.org/articles/to-fight-ad-blocking-build-better-ads/">To Fight Ad Blocking, Build Better Ads</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Automation is clearly the right tool for processing lots of information, such as branch library details. But when it comes to making judgements or adding value in some way, it becomes more fuzzy. While Amazon can make useful suggestions based on what you and others have browsed and bought before you don’t really want to offload your advertising to a machine, especially one owned by a shady third party.</p>

<p>My objection to overautomation isn’t based solely on its accuracy or relevancy, although I would argue that big data isn’t the panacea its producers make it out to be. When it comes to library websites, a list of, say, the 10 latest crime novels added to library stock or the 10 most popular fantasy titles are useful, but I’d value a curated list of recent crime novels more.</p>

<p>After all, the algorithm can only suggest a book by analysing borrower and meta data. It has no idea that a bit of the plot is particularly interesting to local customers, or that it could be linked to a local event unless someone, somewhere has attached impossible amounts of complex meta data to it.</p>

<p>There’s a question of distance, trust and brand here. We <em>know</em> the humans who curate our book lists; we can even go into the library and talk to them. They’re a part of our community. In fact, this is the main advantage libraries have over the likes of Google and Amazon: we’re people you know and can relate to. We’re not flogging you anything, either.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we see overautomation creeping into the library world. While library management systems are a million miles from being able to produce complex algorithms, ideas such as <a href="http://www.bibliotheca.com/3/index.php/en-uk/our-solutions/24-hour-library-open">Open+</a> are used to replace library staff rather than extend opening hours.</p>

<p><strong>We need to be wary of reducing libraries to places that just dispense books</strong>. I can order a bestseller from Amazon and have it on my Kindle in 3 clicks and 30 seconds, or at my house the same day. Travelling to a library and borrowing the same book involves far more effort, and I’ll have to make my way back to the library and return it in 3 weeks.</p>

<p>What libraries can offer over Amazon – and what makes that journey worthwhile – is a combination of environment, experience and expertise, and that means good staff. Removing people from libraries is simply a step on the path to closing them.</p>
