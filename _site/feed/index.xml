        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So much to read into that May defeat. Yet no-one seems willing to &lt;q&gt;learn the hard lessons and make some tough decisions&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the left. We all know Ian Nosferatu Smith is evil, Gideon wants to get rid of the state and the Tory party will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; reveal itself as the nasty party in the end. What we haven’t realised yet is that these aren’t reasons in and of themselves for enough people to vote Labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last five years have been beyond anything else an exercise in finding out just how far up the economic ladder you can fuck over before you start losing votes. And the answer is &lt;em&gt;pretty fucking far&lt;/em&gt;. The lesson is quite simple: you can’t appeal to people’s better natures in order to get votes, you have to appeal to their fears and pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Tories have appeared vaguely competent and dolled out a few bribes and promises of home ownership, the Labour left has waved its flags and gone on big marches. The morally right thing to do, but of limited use. Only once &lt;a href=&quot;/strange-popularity-of-george-osborne/&quot;&gt;the supposedly Machiavellian Gideon&lt;/a&gt; had the smart of idea of making 3 million voters hundreds of pounds worse off have the Tories looked vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sunny said, &lt;a href=&quot;/labour-comms-purpose/&quot;&gt;the left has no idea of how to talk to people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But worse, far worse, is moderate Labour. As least the left is actually right about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Cruddas, Danczuk et al have singularly, blockheadedly refused to learn is that the vast majority of Labour party members are sick of trying to appease austerity and xenophobia. This despite the fact that Jeremy Corbyn (yes, Jeremy Bloody Corbyn) got twice as many &lt;em&gt;party member&lt;/em&gt; votes in the leadership election than any other candidate, and was a single percentage point from getting an overall majority. Forget the three quiders; these are paid up, card carrying members telling the leadership that your job is to oppose austerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at how it might be possible to convert their members’ interests into votes, they simply try and interpret the current consensus, &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; trying to change anything outside the party. You wonder how far right this consensus would have to swing before they actually came up with a counterargument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/25/corbyn-leadership-challenge-labour-mp-threatens-to-stand-if-may-elections-disappoint&quot;&gt;Danczuk apparently really believes he will get members to vote for someone like Chuka or Dan&lt;/a&gt; simply because they seem more reasonable than mad old Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, Cruddas, another tactical mastermind, forms &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/24/jon-cruddas-osborne-appears-more-in-tune-with-north-of-england-than-labour&quot;&gt;a pro-austerity group within Labour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will this end? In some ways you feel the Tories will, true to form, merrily commit suicide over tax credits or Europe. But there needs to be a cogent, credible opposition that can talk to people in terms they understand and trust. At the moment it’s hard to see where that’ll come from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Murder in the cathedral &#8211; on Labour's tragedy (more Hamlet, really)</title>
        <link href="http://www.nobulbs.com/murder-in-the-cathedral/"/>
        <updated>2015-09-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.nobulbs.com/murder-in-the-cathedral//</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll post something more cogent on Labour’s tragedy soon, but, as the players learn their fate and the clock hands approach 12, here are a few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Andy Burnham’s problem was that nobody outside the “Westminster Bubble” uses the phrase “Westminster Bubble”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liz Kendall’s problem was that she ignored the constituency and mouthed stuff about learning hard lessons; true enough, but they were the wrong lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yvette Cooper’s problem was starting too slowly, too timidly; again, she hasn’t grasped the austerity nettle. But she is the best Middle England candidate, where she’ll be known simply as &lt;em&gt;Yvette&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeremy Corbyn’s great accidental strength was simply being against austerity. As such, hundreds of thousands projected their &lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt; onto an old hippy. None of the other candidates, to borrow a horrible business term, were &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt; enough to realise this and adapt their message (Hamlet’s decadent court, if you like).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only Corbyn occupied the real, traditional, social/liberal democratic centre. That means he wins, which must be incredibly frustrating for those who thought they were the centre candidate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 quid voters won’t win a general election.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jeremy Corbyn – one of too many jesters – won’t win a general election.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ed Miliband (another jester) made a fatal error, but it just may save the Labour party because it will have to bury and overcome its recent history (your tragedy’s ghosts).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loyal and hardy footsoldiers were actually leafleting during the high tragedy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best hope for Labour is that the whole tragedy (or farce) does indeed end in a  good old bloodbath. From the ashes rises a proper leader of the old centre, who slays Brown Blairite ghosts and the hippy king. Your Fortinbras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Show me the Next &#8211; genius concept, needs better content</title>
        <link href="http://www.nobulbs.com/show-me-the-next/"/>
        <updated>2015-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.nobulbs.com/show-me-the-next//</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://showmethenext.com/&quot;&gt;Show me the Next&lt;/a&gt; is an incredibly simple app (or rather, an incredibly simple website). You visit, it displays an article and you press a button and it displays another article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://showmethenext.com/wp-content/themes/smtn/style.css&quot;&gt;next to no styling&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;/why-my-site-is-so-simple/&quot;&gt;even less than this website’s&lt;/a&gt; – and no navigation or archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit to liking this idea (it reminds me of &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://guardian.gyford.com/&quot;&gt;Today’s Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;), although I’m not so sure there’s really ever a time when you just want something, anything to read without exercising &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; choice. &lt;cite&gt;Nieman Journalism Lab&lt;/cite&gt; reckons there might be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re on a long escalator with a phone in hand, and you want to thumb through something interesting quickly, without having to look for it. You’re sitting in gridlock traffic and tired of radio. You don’t want to skim Twitter or Facebook — you only want one story at a time, you don’t want to have to search for anything, but you still want to be surprised. &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/show-me-the-next-strips-down-online-reading-and-discovery-to-their-most-basic-components/&quot;&gt;Show Me The Next strips down online reading and discovery to their most basic components&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s right, but you’d need to be an expert curator and have a pool of top quality writing to draw from. At the moment the articles are a little too random, with a lot of stuff from Wikipedia. I don’t think it’s compelling enough when you can dive into McSweeney’s or Longform or your RSS feed with a just a tad more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s potential in the idea, or at least the process and technology behind it. And that’s what I really like about &lt;cite&gt;Show me the Next&lt;/cite&gt;. Pretty much anyone can build a barebones WordPress theme and link it to, say, a Pocket account. No overheads, no maintenance, no app and, most importantly, no actual writing. It works everywhere. Just me, my site and my Pocket button. There’s some real &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt; in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And users don’t have to learn or think about anything at all. That’s always an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What content could work? Fiction? In depth, insider articles on, say, economics? I could get it built in a couple of hours…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why my website looks so plain</title>
        <link href="http://www.nobulbs.com/why-my-site-is-so-simple/"/>
        <updated>2015-09-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.nobulbs.com/why-my-site-is-so-simple//</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It does, doesn’t it? There are no decorative background images, no background gradients (or background colours, for that matter) and no animations. In fact, it barely looks styled at all (slightly misleading that: there are 14 files in my sass folder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason’s quite simple. You don’t need any of that stuff to read articles on my blog. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; put some effort into the things that make words easy or difficult to read on a screen. Body text is &lt;code&gt;23 pixels&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;32 pixel&lt;/code&gt; line height on a wide screen. The text is coloured &lt;code&gt;333&lt;/code&gt; rather than, say, &lt;code&gt;555&lt;/code&gt; on a white background. Lines won’t extend beyond &lt;code&gt;644 pixels&lt;/code&gt;. There’s a half line between paragraphs rather than a full line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was using a different typeface from Freight Text Pro and these articles were 5,000 words long those numbers would be different so you could read just as easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; tweaking these settings. And because I’m always thinking about leading, measure, hierarchy and weight I get good at them. Not that you’d notice. The only thing you’d notice is a huge background image of a Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that when you come to my site readability is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do need to think about background images, gradients, animations etc. when you’re looking to employ me. Things get tricky then, because you’ll be wondering whether I can do all those things that make your website &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; right; when you’re looking at your own website not in terms of how well it works, but how it will impress your boss, peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll get lucky and you’ll like a minimalist look. A lot of people do. Or maybe I’ll change things around a bit. Or maybe you’ll get into these articles and start using this site rather than glancing at it. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ambiguity</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… language in general actually tends to the simplistic, offering a reductive account of what it seeks to represent – it could hardly be otherwise. Hence we prize someone who has managed to put into language, with its relentless and crude semantic segmentation of experience, some of the density and indeed perplexity we feel as we try to get a grip on what is going on around us. — Tim Parks &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/sep/01/clearing-up-ambiguity/&quot;&gt;Clearing up ambiguity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really liked this as it explains what makes writing &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Writing that makes you skip back through the text and reassemble the words and their meaning; not becuase the sentence has been phrased clumsily, but because it offers several interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wading through too much non–ambiguous writing recently, mostly horror. There’s a lot of existential ambiguity in Lovecraft, but the prose is tortuous rather than nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where that leaves didactic writers who are masters of ambiguity. Perhaps that’s Tolstoy’s strength?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Liz Kendall, an apology (and an appreciation of some of her ideas)</title>
        <link href="http://www.nobulbs.com/liz-kendall-apology-and-appreciation/"/>
        <updated>2015-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.nobulbs.com/liz-kendall-apology-and-appreciation//</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I (we) owe Liz Kendall an apology. Firstly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/15/liz-kendall-labour-supporters-should-be-called-out-over-vitriolic-online-abuse&quot;&gt;she’s right to call out some party members on the tone of their criticism of her&lt;/a&gt;; it’s downright unpleasant, often sexist, and jars with Jeremy Corbyn’s &lt;em&gt;we don’t do personal&lt;/em&gt; message. It really is very fucking personal, and a gruesome glimpse into a certain left psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not entirely unguilty, and was quick to join in with the &lt;a href=&quot;/labours-constituency/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;she’s a Tory&lt;/em&gt; name calling&lt;/a&gt;. Liz Kendall is not a Tory. Unfortunately, she made a catastrophic tactical error by setting herself against the traditional Labour party membership so staunchly from the outset – ironic, considering her radical ideas on devolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re the people who’ll vote (or probably not vote) for her, and the centralised, Blairite command and control approach hasn’t won an election for a decade. Who are the party leaders to tell us where we’ve gone wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and more importantly, we’ve missed out on some interesting policy ideas. One criticism you could make of Corbyn is that there’s not much devolution in his world view; in that sense it represents &lt;a href=&quot;http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/07/on-corbynomics.html&quot;&gt;a continuation of centralised managerialism, just with a different set of bosses&lt;/a&gt;. And Kendall is, I think, quite interesting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leading-labour&quot;&gt;Leading Labour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve published &lt;a href=&quot;/liz-kendall&quot;&gt;Kendall’s &lt;cite&gt;Leading Labour&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; statement. Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-idea-is-devolution&quot;&gt;The big idea is devolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I like this. A lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for a divested mutual and we provide Suffolk a better library service than when we were a part of the County Council. We can make what we think are sensible decisions and act on them quickly (most of the time – the council signed a 5 year contract with our library management system provider back in 2012, so we’re stuck with that until 2017. We won’t be signing 5 year contracts for antiquated software in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a lot better than a Serco or Capita. And because we make smarter decisions outside of some insane, bureacratic framework, we save money too. Unlike Suffolk County Council, we also pay the living wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left really should welcome the idea of smaller, devolved, mutuals, and Kendall does differentiate this from risible big society ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Tories claim they want to devolve power throughout Britain. Yet they fail to match new responsibilities for councils with the resources and fair funding councils require. And the Treasury still controls everything including insisting combined authorities have elected mayors, whether local people want them or not. But Labour has been too timid on devolution in the past, and too slow to seize this agenda for our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As leader I will champion a new, comprehensive, nationwide model of devolution within the nations of the United Kingdom, including England. That means working with our cities, towns and counties to help them take on more power and responsibility over welfare, housing, health, education, transport and economic growth. Under my leadership, local authorities will be equal partners with ministers agreeing a new settlement for devolved powers and responsibilities every Treasury budget cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To tackle the real inequalities of wealth, opportunity and power that we face, Britain must undergo a radical and vast devolution of where power and decision making lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a socialist it must be hard to disagree with a devolved, mutual view of the world, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slayed-by-the-ghost-of-the-austerians&quot;&gt;Slayed by the Ghost of the Austerians&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, events have completely overtaken Kendall (and Cooper and Burnham). Corbyn has grasped the austerity nettle which means – incredibly – he’ll win the leadership contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/labours-liz-kendall-i-have-no-problem-aiming-for-budget-surplus&quot;&gt;silly, tactical noises to the electorate as a whole about ‘tackling the deficit’&lt;/a&gt; straight after an election defeat was a catastrophic mistake. All the leadership contenders should have addressed (no, &lt;em&gt;courted&lt;/em&gt;) the party and its natural constituency of public sector workers, the low paid, the unemployed, students, academics and liberals. Like I say, we’re the people choosing the leader, not the couldn’t-care-less voters of Ipswich, Lowestoft and Clacton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not stupid. We don’t &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; Osborne when he talks about managing the economy well. We know how harmful he is. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to at least &lt;em&gt;discuss&lt;/em&gt; an alternative beyond &lt;em&gt;we can’t do anything until we get into power and this is the only way to win elections&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall notes &lt;q&gt;[The Tories] fail to match new responsibilities for councils with the resources and fair funding councils require&lt;/q&gt;, which is of course right. Although we’re more efficient than the previous library regime, we won’t be able to invest in, or maintain, the service if the Council continues to cut our funding every single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But devolution in and of itself won’t cure that problem; tackling low productivity, lack of investment and underemployment will. Being a deficit fetishist will just make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame Kendall has sold herself as the Blairite candidate. Blairism is dead. It’s unforgivable, but perhaps unsurprising considering the years they’ve spent at the top of the party, that Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were unable to formulate any new vision or narrative for the party to get behind. Kendall is fresher, and does have some interesting, radical ideas. Perhaps her time will come again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, for better or worse, it looks like we’re going to get Jeremy Corbyn. God knows how that will end.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Occupy the centre, comrades</title>
        <link href="http://www.nobulbs.com/occupy-deserted-centre-pragmatism/"/>
        <updated>2015-07-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.nobulbs.com/occupy-deserted-centre-pragmatism//</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/tony-blair-labour-return-centre-ground-general-election-defeat&quot;&gt;British elections are won from the centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where is the centre? As in all things philosophical, the centre is a relative concept. It needs two poles to place itself between, namely the left and the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, elections aren’t only won from the centre. What Blair meant was: elections are won by pragmatists who understand credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s right, of course, but Blairite and Cleggian pragmatism also helped shift the centre towards the right. Not everyone likes that. It puts things out of kilter. You don’t have to be a Trot to think it leads to some downright &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2523819/Plan-cap-benefit-children-New-mothers-children-lose-700-5bn-welfare-crackdown.html&quot;&gt;unpleasant consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movement you represent can only take so much of it. Hence the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zizek notes this is an opportunity for what’s nostalgically termed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/Slavoj-Zizek-greece-chance-europe-awaken&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;hard left&lt;/i&gt; to occupy the old centre ground&lt;/a&gt;. And Corbyn is leading a merry dance into this &lt;a href=&quot;/the-last-liberal-centre-broke&quot;&gt;deserted liberal democrat land&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/26/jeremy-corbyn-team-shocked-momentum&quot;&gt;See how happy this makes the troops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beware: credibility and authenticity are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His opponents are panicking because they have absolutely no idea of how to respond – apart from moving deeper into the pragmatic right while mumbling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/liz-kendall-labour-can-win-power-and-keep-principles&quot;&gt;a few compassionate words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition mass electorates like things that come from the centre. Even the social democratic left, having shifted to the old centre right, could relearn this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: can the centre be redefined? Or has it been destroyed? Is it merely rhetorical? That’s what a new Labour leader should explore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Moebius&quot;&gt;Dieter Moebius&lt;/a&gt; died earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/moebius.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dieter Moebius&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;figcaption&quot;&gt;Dieter Moebius performing in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of him, that’s a shame. He was half of my favourite Krautrock group &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_%28band%29&quot;&gt;Cluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many wonderful things about Cluster was their other worldliness. I mean this in two ways. Firstly, their music often sounds alien:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vid&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQ8jMR_JTfE?rel=0&amp;amp;controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the music sits resolutely outside the US and British traditions of experimental rock music. No echo of Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis or Little Richard, even though Moebius was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.frieze.com/interview-dieter-moebius/&quot;&gt;amazed when he first heard Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt; and admired the Velvet Underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Moebius, Elvis was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schlage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Schlage was West Germany’s easy listening. It’s slightly disconcerting watching this clip when you consider what was happening in the country just 15–20 years before):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vid&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnMhkkgWpG4?start=1045&amp;amp;controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike 60s UK and US rockers, the likes of Amon Düül II, Faust and Cluster never slipped into easy, lucrative retirement. Rather wonderfully, they continue to make radical, obscure and experimental music to this day, in all sorts of collaborations and forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cluster are a stranger Kraftwerk. If you haven’t heard them, start with &lt;cite&gt;Zuckerzeit&lt;/cite&gt; and then try &lt;cite&gt;Sowiesoso&lt;/cite&gt;. You’ll never look back.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What we can learn from the Tories in opposition (and how there's an opportunity for the new Labour leader to remold the party)</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, so I’m no analyst, academic, journalist, politician or philosopher and, if you’re interested, you will have heard or read 1001 opinions on who and what Labour should choose in the forthcoming leadership election. However, I am a Labour party member and I have thought hard about this. Here’s my twopenneth…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth looking at how the Tories fared in opposition. In 1997, they lost big – Labour won a 179(!) seat majority. The first post–Major leader was William Hague, who proceeded to lose big again, after which Ian Duncan Smith(!!) took the Tory helm. After that debacle the Tories selected Michael Howard – a relatively safe pair of hands – then finally settled on David Cameron after Howard lost the 2005 election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone once asked: what really went on there? And what can we learn from it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-leader-is-all-important&quot;&gt;1. The leader is all important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that strikes me is I don’t remember a single Tory policy during the Blair and Brown years. Even Osborne and Cameron were quite happy to support Labour’s spending plans. I do, however, recall how shit Ian Duncan Smith was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vid&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXmQdi9pwDA?t=64&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe first leader after an election loss is a particularly difficult gig. However, Ed Miliband was a bad choice in the same way as Ian Duncan Smith, something the party sensed by backing his more rightwing but experienced brother. Like IDS Ed’s main battle was against his fundamental lack of credibility, which meant he spent most his time pulling the &lt;em&gt;good leader&lt;/em&gt; levers rather than expressing a &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt;. There were lots of good policies, but Ed always looked desperate and untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-government-holds-all-the-cards-opposition-is-about-opposing-well&quot;&gt;2. The government holds all the cards, opposition is about opposing well&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should remember Labour enjoyed a remarkably long honeymoon period, governing in a relative sea of calm. In 2001 their majority was reduced by a measly 12 seats. David Cameron became Tory leader post–Iraq, when the cracks were beginning to appear in the New Labour project. If he was a few years older his story would have probably been a lot different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition is just that. If the governing party appears to be doing a decent, competent job it’s unlikely the electorate will boot them out. All you can do is make life as difficult as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was absurd for Labour not to vote against the recent welfare bill, a complete failure in their duty to the country and the party. If it does have some sort of problem with appearing ‘soft on welfare’ who cares 5 years out from the next election? Unlike the 1997 Labour government, the Tories have a tiny majority of 12. They are vulnerable and should be attacked at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-not-the-policies&quot;&gt;3. It’s not the policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember a single policy put forward by David Cameron in opposition? Themes, yes: the big society, hug a hoodie etc. All these told the story of a new, nicer Conservative party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will sound strange, but I’m sure it’s true. Policies in opposition are largely unimportant. Come election time that changes. Before then it’s mood, themes and, most of all, &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt;. All of which serve to make you more credible and electable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can drop the narrative once you’re in power. The big society was buried quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason Jeremy Corbyn appears to be so popular is that he doesn’t care how his policies play out in the electorate’s mind. He does, however, offer a simple, powerful story that resonates strongly with party members. Like Nigel Farage, you can believe he believes what he’s saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Kendall is &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; clear about the Labour party’s purpose and problems; namely, that it’s shit and should give up on all that socialist stuff altogether. That’s easy to understand – the only problem is there wouldn’t be a Labour party left if she became leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What of Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham? Could you name one thing they believe in? What’s their narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is time and space to actually express an opinion about something rather than react to things. This isn’t a time for tactics but belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yvette-coopers-opportunity&quot;&gt;Yvette Cooper’s opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour party is dead on its knees, enervated by years of defensiveness and tortuous tactical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one good thing about opposition is that it gives you time to think things through, to establish a new narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yvette Cooper &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a good leader. Although Corbyn has the best narrative he has an IDS credibility problem – the public won’t take him seriously as a leader. Liz Kendall is beginning to form a narrative, although she’s not particularly inspiring. More importantly, that narrative will destroy the party from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two ‘sane’ choices, Cooper ticks a lot of boxes. She’s talented, politically experienced and has lived in what politicians refer to as the real world. And, not to be too blunt, she is a woman. Electing a female leader would signal a clear change, and David Cameron has a woman problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vid&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/politics/video/2011/apr/27/david-cameron-calm-down-dear&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;484&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be great if Cooper could establish a new narrative that appealed to the party. In my opinion, a traditional centre offering based around a theme of compassion would do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would re–energise party members in these far right times, while providing a clear challenge to the Conservatives. Although policy detail isn’t important, a grand gesture wouldn’t go amiss. Something along the lines of scrapping tuition fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is she capable? Or have years of tactical manouvering made it impossible? I fear the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
