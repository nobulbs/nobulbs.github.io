			</div>

			<div class="entry-content">

				<p>A twitter pal is about to read a slew of American novels on the commute into work. While I wouldn’t wish Greater Anglia on anyone, the sole advantage to commuting is that it gives you a parcel of time in which you can do something you want, free of distractions.</p>

<p>When I commuted from Ipswich to Colchester I devoured all the Russian classics, Dickens and plenty of Sebald over the course of a couple of years, among lots of other bits and pieces. It was by far the best thing about my job.</p>

<p>(This all assumes you’re not one of those businessmen with a brick for a laptop who absolutely must read your email before you get to work, or that Greater Anglia allows you a seat by the time the train arrives at your stop.)</p>

<p>Anyway, recently I was granted not one but two 90 minute return train journeys (the sole advantage to not being able to drive) to Lowestoft. I’ve got out of the habit of reading recently, so I decided to try a collection of M R James stories entitled <cite>A Thin Ghost and Others</cite> as the train rolled though Darsham, Saxmundham and Beccles (appropriately quaint, middle of nowhere settings).</p>

<p>I enjoyed the book, although the thing about horror that can put me off (and this goes for any genre) are the clunking conventions; which is to say a lot of horror stories are essentially the same. Now, James may well have invented a lot of the rules of horror, and in a way they make reading – and writing, no doubt – easier. So we know text x will contain some dark secret, and something odd will happen to the protagonist when he (it’s always a he) goes to sleep in new surroundings. I guess some readers, ironically enough, may find comfort in convention, but it can grate over a series of short stories.</p>

<p>Still, there’s some fun to be had in decoding what all these recurrent events and images mean: the most obvious being the suppressed presence of James’ homosexuality. This is a male world (although that’s hardly rare in early 20th century writing), and the stories often climax with a very close, very physical encounter with a more or less male form in the middle of the night. It doesn’t really take much to interpret these embraces in a certain way; what’s more interesting is the sense of fear, eroticism, claustrophobia and domination they convey.</p>

<p>And what’s really good – and truly scary – about James are the wild, fevered events written in cool, conversational prose. They’re genuinely nightmarish. It’d perhaps be crass to attribute these to James’ secret homosexuality, but there is something in the writing itself that’s breathless and scared. The best example is from <cite><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Story_of_a_Disappearance_and_an_Appearance">The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance</a></cite>. If you don’t find this unsettling, James probably isn’t for you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The baby –it sounds more ridiculous as I go on –the baby, I am sure, was alive. Punch wrung its neck, and if the choke or squeak which it gave were not real, I know nothing of reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stage got perceptibly darker as each crime was consummated, and at last there was one murder which was done quite in the dark, so that I could see nothing of the victim, and took some time to effect. It was accompanied by hard breathing and horrid muffled sounds, and after it Punch came and sat on the foot-board and fanned himself and looked at his shoes, which were bloody, and hung his head on one side, and sniggered in so deadly a fashion that I saw some of those beside me cover their faces, and I would gladly have done the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At length there came a moment when Punch, evidently exhausted, staggered in from the left and threw himself down among the trees. His pursuer was not long after him, and came looking uncertainly from side to side. Then, catching sight of the figure on the ground, he too threw himself down – his back was turned to the audience – with a swift motion twitched the covering from his head, and thrust his face into that of Punch. Everything on the instant grew dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I find it hard to figure out why I’ve come to enjoy horror stories for the first time since I read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Book_of_Horror_Stories">Pan collections</a> when I was a teenager. I suspect it’s partly because I simply have no time (or energy) to read properly (a poor excuse, I know), and they’re not challenging in the way Bellow or Pynchon are. But there is something unhealthily attractive about horror as you get older. Perhaps it’s feeling mortal, or even just understanding cruelty and nastiness more.</p>
