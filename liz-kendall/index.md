title: Liz Kendall's Leading Labour statement
---
[<cite>Leading Labour</cite>](http://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Leading-Labour-the-Fabian-essays-Aug-15.pdf) is a short document outlining the 4 Labour leader contenders' broad philosophies. It's one of the most useful resources for anyone looking for a _fairly_ unspun, rhetoric free overview of what you get from Cooper, Corbyn, Kendall and Burnham. This is Liz Kendall's statement (because HTML is better than PDF, right?)

<hr>

This year we lost a second general election in a row. And make no mistake, we lost it badly.

Rather than returning to government we went backwards, losing seats and allowing the Tories to achieve a majority that some in our party had complacently considered impossible.

And we lost for a simple reason: we didn't trust people. Our answer to too many of the problems we face as a country was to regulate, to restrict, to fix, or ban. Too often, we spoke as if the challenges facing Britain could be solved by Westminster politicians and Whitehall civil servants alone.

The solutions Labour needs to tackle inequality and win next time are rooted in restoring that bond of trust.

Losing an election hurts, not just because we've been rejected, but because we can't put our values into action, and we can't tackle the inequalities of modern Britain. Losing makes us ask difficult questions of ourselves.

And at these difficult times for our party it can sometimes feel like we're struggling to articulate what we're for. But the answer is clear: we are the people's party. And when we're at our best we are both trusted by those people and willing to place our trust in them.

Our politics must be of the people, for the people, and by the people.
Labour's vision must be for people in every corner of our country to have
the power and control to shape their own lives. I want to see employees with
a say and a stake in their workplace and for everyone who has an idea about
how to set up and grow a small business or community enterprise to get the
backing they need.

Supporting people to do things for themselves: that is the only way we'll
tackle the inequalities that are growing in Conservative-ruled Britain. The
deeply regressive Tory budget demonstrated, as if there were any doubt, that
the Labour party's enduring mission to fight for greater equality will be more
relevant than ever in the coming years.

But supporting people to do things for themselves means we cannot stand
by whilst the Tories cut away at the backing the state provides. Long-term,
our aim must be for an economy where work pays well enough to live on.
That's why I'd make building a living wage society a priority, and give the
Low Pay Commission greater powers to drive up low pay. And I'd review
the Â£100bn cost of tax reliefs to find the money to restore working tax credits
and give public sector workers the pay rise they need and deserve.

And Labour has always stood for progressive taxation and the need to
move resources from the wealthy to the poor. That's why I oppose George
Osborne's cut to inheritance tax.

Yet that can't be the sum of our ambitions. In our brightest days we saw
that equality was about more than transfer payments. Being equal is about
how we're treated by the people and institutions around us. It's about living
in circumstances which give us self-respect, dignity and a sense of control
over our own lives.

We have to accept that despite the huge advances that we're rightly proud
of, great inequalities still remained after Labour's time in government. Indeed
they have been on the rise for decades. The process of deindustrialisation
ended the secure path many had through life. It undermined the sense of
place our people and country had in the world. It destroyed the solidarity
which used to be at the centre of community life, and pushed our kind of
politics into crisis with it.

So a post-industrial Labour party had to do things differently. Our
response, between 1997 and 2010, was to use the proceeds of Britain's financial boom to spend money on public services and physical infrastructure, and
to legislate against many social iniquities. I'm proud of the schools we built,
our new hospitals and colleges, our Sure Start centres and leisure centres. I'm
proud too that we introduced the national minimum wage and tax credits
to make sure work pays. But buildings, laws and tax credits don't create the
conditions for a good life on their own.

This comes when people have a sense of power and control over their
own lives. From the relationships we have with our family, friends, work
colleagues and neighbours, and the bonds we build with others. The early
Labour movement understood this.

## A new settlement

We need a new political settlement where power is devolved to the nations,
cities, towns, and counties of Britain. Our political union remains fragile: each
of our nations must have a greater say shaping its own destiny. Devolution
to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is accelerating. I believe we must
support England's right to its own voice, too. Devolution goes hand in hand
with our sense of identity, belonging and pride.

   The Tories claim they want to devolve power throughout Britain. Yet they
fail to match new responsibilities for councils with the resources and fair
funding councils require. And the Treasury still controls everything including insisting combined authorities have elected mayors, whether local people
want them or not. But Labour has been too timid on devolution in the past,
and too slow to seize this agenda for our own.

   As leader I will champion a new, comprehensive, nationwide model of
devolution within the nations of the United Kingdom, including England.
That means working with our cities, towns and counties to help them take
on more power and responsibility over welfare, housing, health, education,
transport and economic growth. Under my leadership, local authorities will
be equal partners with ministers agreeing a new settlement for devolved
powers and responsibilities every Treasury budget cycle.

To tackle the real inequalities of wealth, opportunity and power that we
face, Britain must undergo a radical and vast devolution of where power and
decision making lies.

## Debate and decide

Handing money and power to local councils isn't enough, though. We also
need to move power out from Whitehall and beyond the town hall, to people
in workplaces and schools and communities. We must ensure the voices of
service users and citizens drive our public institutions to improve, and hold
businesses to account.

The change we need is to make decisions in a way that gives each of us a
real stake and a real say. Power in people's hands. That is what Labour stands
for. Yesterday, today and always.

I've championed greater public involvement in decision-making ever since
I wrote the first book on citizens' juries in 1994. The argument I made back
then remains true today: we will get better decisions if we involve people
who see the impact of policies for themselves. And we'll get better value for
money too because citizens are more careful than civil servants about where
their taxes are spent.

There's now a wealth of experience from around the world about involving citizens in decision-making. For example, Melbourne's people's panel
reshaped the city's $4bn budget plan, and persuaded the council to increase
charges on land developers and spend more money on green measures. We
must ensure power lies with people in their workplaces, public services,
schools and streets, not just the town hall.

`Government of the people, for the people, by the people'. Our politics
needs to be ruled by that old principle. Abraham Lincoln made those words
famous at the Gettysburg address, but they have a far longer history on this
side of the Atlantic. They were first printed in John Wycliffe's first translation of the Bible into English. And they summarise a commitment to trust
the judgement of the people come what may. It is a commitment that's been
central to radical politics for more than 600 years. It is a commitment Labour
must now renew.

So whilst the Tories leave those who are weak on their own, help those
who are already strong, and hoard power within a narrow elite, Labour will
put power into people's hands so they can help themselves, and one another
too.

That requires a new political settlement, which devolves power to the
nations, cities, towns and counties of Britain. It means radical reform of our
institutions so people have a say and a stake in how they are run. It means
supporting people, as individuals and in their families and in their communities, to have control over the resources and services that shape their lives.
And it means ensuring our party is an active part of every community and
respects the people's judgement always, not just in the wake of a shattering
defeat.

Too many politicians think power is something for themselves, rather than
something to be shared with individuals and communities. As leader, I want
Labour to win power in order to give it away.
