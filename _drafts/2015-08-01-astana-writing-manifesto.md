title: The agnostic web &#8211; An Astana reader and writer's web manifesto for 2015
---

The good news: the web remains a place of great joy and wonder.

The bad: it's poorly designed and treats you like an idiot.

This is not a technical problem. It's philosophical.

We hold these beliefs as self-evidently true.

## 1. Web pages should be device agnostic

It doesn't matter whether you're reading this on an 80 inch plasma screen or an obscure hand phone. It's a modern miracle that I can write this and you can read it on your obscure, seven year old phone.

Designers take this miracle for granted. This page may look fabulous on a retina MacBook, but it may not even load on your phone.

That's rude. And stupid. I want as many readers as possible. Including you.

Designer action! Design mobile and content first.

## 2. Web pages should be browser agnostic

Your phone's old but you can't really afford a new one.

Your phone's browser is a customised version of Chrome, although you don't really know that; the icon just says 'Web'.

It's not your fault it's so flakey.

I want as many readers as possible, including you.

Designer action! Design defensively so as many readers as possible can read your writing.

## 3. Web pages should be light

This shouldn't really need stating. Why build heavy web pages?

You live in oil rich Kazakstan. All hail president Nazarbayev.

the capital Astana has a marvelous shopping centre with a beach in it. The mobile data network is patchy. Wifi is often crap.

You own a Samsung Instinct mobile phone. As we know, it has a web browser.

I'd like to you read my writing. Especially when so many websites are an absolute PITA to load. I guess the network and your old phone aren't great for browsing. You'll buy an iPhone 6 one day.

Designer action! Avoid needless animations, font files, CSS and javascript when you build web pages.

## 4. Web pages should be polite

Isn't it great that I can track your browsing even when you leave my website?

Or at least pass on your browsing history to someone who'll use that information to serve you personalised adverts in the future.

I don't even need to ask your permission. That's smooth.

And they'll pay me for it!

I'll let you into a secret. The reason browsing on your phone is such a PITA isn't just because of your phone or the Kazakstani network. No.

Believe it or not, I don't help. I chuck tons of code at you that tracks what websites you visit. It slows your phone down. Sorry.

Designer action! Don't use tracking code. It's fucking rude. As are popovers.

## 5. A picture doesn't tell a thousand words. A thousand words tells a thousand words.

Now I'd like to show you a picture that conveys my personal brand:

I'm hip, me. I'm into Macbooks, Moleskines and artisinal coffee. So are all my friends.

Bet you're jealous out there in Astana. Don't worry: one day all this will be yours.

Oddly enough, lots of us here share this personal brand. I've heard it called obligatory coffee syndrome.

Now, remember your old phone. Conveying my personal brand just ate up 375kb of your data allowance. Ouch!

I feel bad about that. Here's something that'll use up less of your data allowance and perhaps improve your life more than my personal brand statement.

You may have read it, actually. I'm not sure how Czech authors play in Kazakstan.

Designer action! Words are an efficient means of communication. Use images sparingly to aid understanding and enjoyment.

## 6. Web pages should be fast

Not only was my personal brand statement expensive, it took a long time to reach your phone.

All the things I've talked about slow your internet experience down. Let me tell you, we're not happy here when the internet's slow. Not at all.

We're spoilt. We don't appreciate how vital speed is, until it's gone.

Luckliy, we can exchange personal brand statements pretty quickly over our networks and phone. Most of the time. But often websites do slow down on phones because of all the pointless tracking, animations, images and stuff.

Designer action! Put speed at number 1. Use resources sparingly.
