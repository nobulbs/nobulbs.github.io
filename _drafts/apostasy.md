Why join a political party? Why become an MP? The answers to these questions may well differ, but, if we're not being cynical, let's assume they're similar. You believe x and y and party z broadly tries to attain x and y.

So most Tories will say they believe in self-reliance, reducing the size of the state, maintaining a British way of life, supporting aspiration, commonsense etc. etc., while Labourites believe in shared endeavour, equality, unions.

Most of us understand that politics itself is a business of compromise.
