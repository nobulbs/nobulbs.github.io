title: How the Labour party died
---

On Monday 14 September the Labour party will announce its death. The ritual &#8211; I won't call it a funeral &#8211; will take place in solemn Westminster. What drama as the high priests of the current party watch on (with some contempt, I suspect) as a false prophet is anointed.

This is what a grass roots movement looks like. Three quid and you're in. Twenty five years of pounding the pavements, attending council meetings, voting in obscure, internal elections count for nada. Unfair, but maybe not all bad. After all, Labour finds it hard to win at the moment. It needs to change.

What happened? How did a once terrifying, election gobbling machine become a the mouthpiece of a largish pressure group? As with all great tragedies, the seeds of self&#8211;destruction were sown early in the drama&hellip;

## Cult of personalities die with the personalities

Tony Blair was &#8211; and is &#8211; a popular leader. Gordon Brown less so, but a titan nonetheless. Labour was defined by these two men and their struggle for power for 16 years. They worked. They got things done. But they squashed debate and the careers of talented future leaders. New Labour MPs became defined not by their ideas or qualities but by whether they were Blairite or Brownite.

Get rid of these men and what's left? The echo of former battles and vendettas. Competent, loyal but uninspiring alternatives incapable of defining a new Labour direction beyond a set of ideas defined by the two grand old men. An anemic generation of Burnhams. Ed Miliband, for God's sake.

When you can't even appeal to the loyal, twenty five year veterans, what chance do you have with the fiery three quid brigade.

## Inoffensive competence won't win elections

We're pro&#8211;austerity but quite nice with it. We'll reduce the deficit, only a little more slowly. Boring. Wrong. Lazy, even. How on earth do you expect Labour party members of all stripes, let alone the _hard left_ to get behind that message? Most of us work in the public sector &#8211; we're your constituency.

It won't win elections either, as we've found out. You need to come up with a new set of ideas. You didn't, so we'll look elsewhere.

## You won the argument against militancy in 1983, not austerity

1983 is a long, long time ago, but I'm old enough to remember Michael Foot. My god. I'm ambivalent over saint Tony. When you say we defeated the militants in 80s and this was a good thing _I get it_. But what you fail to understand is that the battle was against a faction of the Labour party, _not_ against a set of ideas that were wrong at the height of the Thatcher years.

Turns out old Marx was right about the internal contradictions of unfettered capitalism. The basic argument that neoliberalism is fine as long as we try and control its undesirable effects has been thoroughly trounced. Look around you &#8211; if you're poor or ill you are fucked in the UK. And you can't even vote _against_ the welfare bill?

How to respond to this new, harder world? That's what Labour's for, no? Simply regurgitating messages about aspiration won't cut it in 2015.

## Complacency is punished in politics

The new Blairite Liz Kendall came to us with a tough message about why we lost in May. And we did say "fuck off, Liz", and Liz will come last in the leadership election.

The old, Blairite wing of the party assumed that, as in 2010, we'd simply vote for the 'sensible' candidate, even though the message is outdated and uninspiring. Becuase it's failed to overcome Blair it's ossified, become a pale shadow of its former self.

Too long at the top of the party mouthing the same hollow prayers of aspiration, controls on immigration etc. etc. Blairism has breathed its last breath.
