title: Using Cloudcannon as a cloud based CMS with Jekyll
---

This is a test post. I'm trying out [Cloudcannon](http://cloudcannon), a web based CMS that hooks into Github (and plays nicely with Jekyll).

So I'm editing this page with Safari on an iPad. I'm still using the text editor as I'm not sure how the visual editor works, and whether it'll pick up the front matter, but the initial signs are good.

Why could this be a big thing? Well, static sites that can be edited easily are kind of a holy grail. They're secure, fast, portable and easy to maintain. If you use Github Pages they're also free to host.

Developers set up accounts for their clients. If that works well I'll be using Cloudcannon in the future. Let's see; I'll update this post as I go along.
