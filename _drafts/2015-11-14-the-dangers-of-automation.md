title: The dangers of automation
---

Software automates. If you're running a website this is a good thing; for example, we have software that loops through library data, prints a list of all the branches and generates a page for each one with its address, opening hours and events. If we had to do this manually it'd be a full time job (and a boring one at that).

We fear the machines taking over, the power of the algorithm. But the dangers don't just lie in the future: automating the wrong things is already causing problems. The mess that newspapers have got themselves in over advertising and performance are down to offloading their advertising to some machine somewhere or other:

> But when publishers don’t sell ads themselves, they use third-party services to fill those remaining spots. Third-party services use an automated bidding system to match ads with websites, based on whom advertisers want to reach, which audiences different publishers serve, and what rates both parties are willing to accept. Advertisers can target increasingly specific user profiles based on information collected through cookies placed on a user’s computer. <cite>[To Fight Ad Blocking, Build Better Ads](http://niemanreports.org/articles/to-fight-ad-blocking-build-better-ads/)</cite>
