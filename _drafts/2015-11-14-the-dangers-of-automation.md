title: The dangers of automation
---

Software automates. If you're running a website this is a good thing; for example, we have software that loops through library data, prints a list of all the branches and generates a page for each one with its address, opening hours and events. If we had to do this manually it'd be a full time job (and a boring one at that).

We fear the machines taking over, the power of the algorithm. But the dangers don't just lie in the future: automating the wrong things is already causing problems. The mess that newspapers have got themselves in over advertising and performance are down to offloading their advertising to some machine somewhere or other:

> But when publishers don’t sell ads themselves, they use third-party services to fill those remaining spots. Third-party services use an automated bidding system to match ads with websites, based on whom advertisers want to reach, which audiences different publishers serve, and what rates both parties are willing to accept. Advertisers can target increasingly specific user profiles based on information collected through cookies placed on a user’s computer. <cite>[To Fight Ad Blocking, Build Better Ads](http://niemanreports.org/articles/to-fight-ad-blocking-build-better-ads/)</cite>

Automation is clearly the right tool for processing lots of information, such as branch library details. But when it comes to making judgements or adding value in some way, it becomes more fuzzy. While Amazon can make suggestions based on what you've bought before you don't really want to offload your advertising to a machine, especially one owned by a shady third party.

My objection to overautomation isn't based solely on its accuracy or relevancy, although I would argue that big data isn't the panacea it's made out to be by its producers. While a list of, say, the 10 latest crime novels added to library stock or or the 10 most popular fantasy titles are useful, I'd value a curated list of recent crime novels more. After all, the algorithm can't tell how good a book is, or a bit of the plot that our local customers might find particulalrly interesting, or relate it to a cultural event.

No, there's a question of trust and brand here. We _know_ the humans who curate our book lists; we can even go into the library and talk to them. You could argue this is the greatest advantage libraries have over the likes of Google and Amazon: we're humans you know and trust.
