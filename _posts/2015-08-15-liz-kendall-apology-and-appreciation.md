title: Liz Kendall, an apology (and an appreciation of some of her ideas)
---

I (we) owe Liz Kendall an apology. Firstly, [she's right to call out some party members on the tone of their criticism of her](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/15/liz-kendall-labour-supporters-should-be-called-out-over-vitriolic-online-abuse); it's downright unpleasant, often sexist, and jars with Jeremy Corbyn's _we don't do personal_ message. It really is very fucking personal, and a gruesome glimpse into a certain left psyche.

Now, I'm not entirely unguilty, and was quick to join in with the [_she's a Tory_ name calling](/labours-constituency/). Liz Kendall is not a Tory. Unfortunately, she made a catastrophic tactical error by setting herself against the traditional Labour party membership so staunchly from the outset &#8211; ironic, considering her radical ideas on devolution.

We're the people who'll vote (or probably not vote) for her, and the centralised, Blairite command and control approach hasn't won an election for a decade. Who are the party leaders to tell us where we've gone wrong?

Secondly, and more importantly, we've missed out on some interesting policy ideas. One criticism you could make of Corbyn is that there's not much devolution in his world view; in that sense it represents [a continuation of centralised managerialism, just with a different set of bosses](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/07/on-corbynomics.html). And Kendall is, I think, quite interesting here.

## Leading Labour

I've published [Kendall's <cite>Leading Labour</cite>](/liz-kendall) statement. Here are my thoughts.

### The big idea is devolution

And I like this. A lot!

I work for a divested mutual and we provide Suffolk a better library service than when we were a part of the County Council. We can make what we think are sensible decisions and act on them quickly (most of the time &#8211; the council signed a 5 year contract with our library management system provider back in 2012, so we're stuck with that until 2017. We won't be signing 5 year contracts for antiquated software in the future.)

We're a lot better than a Serco or Capita. And because we make smarter decisions outside of some insane, bureacratic framework, we save money too. Unlike Suffolk County Council, we also pay the living wage.

The left really should welcome the idea of smaller, devolved, mutuals, and Kendall does differentiate this from risible big society ideas:

> The Tories claim they want to devolve power throughout Britain. Yet they fail to match new responsibilities for councils with the resources and fair funding councils require. And the Treasury still controls everything including insisting combined authorities have elected mayors, whether local people want them or not. But Labour has been too timid on devolution in the past, and too slow to seize this agenda for our own.

> As leader I will champion a new, comprehensive, nationwide model of devolution within the nations of the United Kingdom, including England. That means working with our cities, towns and counties to help them take on more power and responsibility over welfare, housing, health, education, transport and economic growth. Under my leadership, local authorities will be equal partners with ministers agreeing a new settlement for devolved powers and responsibilities every Treasury budget cycle.

> To tackle the real inequalities of wealth, opportunity and power that we face, Britain must undergo a radical and vast devolution of where power and decision making lies.

If you're a socialist it must be hard to disagree with a devolved, mutual view of the world, no?

### Slayed by the Ghost of the Austerians

Of course, events have completely overtaken Kendall (and Cooper and Burnham). Corbyn has grasped the austerity nettle which means &#8211; incredibly &#8211; he'll win the leadership contest.

Making [silly, tactical noises to the electorate as a whole about &#8216;tackling the deficit&#8217;](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/labours-liz-kendall-i-have-no-problem-aiming-for-budget-surplus) straight after an election defeat was a catastrophic mistake. All the leadership contenders should have addressed (no, _courted_) the party and its natural constituency of public sector workers, the low paid, the unemployed, students, academics and liberals. Like I say, we're the people choosing the leader, not the couldn't-care-less voters of Ipswich, Lowestoft and Clacton.

We're not stupid. We don't _believe_ Osborne when he talks about managing the economy well. We know how harmful he is. We _need_ to at least _discuss_ an alternative beyond _we can't do anything until we get into power and this is the only way to win elections_.

Kendall notes <q>[The Tories] fail to match new responsibilities for councils with the resources and fair funding councils require</q>, which is of course right. Although we're more efficient than the previous library regime, we won't be able to invest in, or maintain, the service if the Council continues to cut our funding every single year.

But devolution in and of itself won't cure that problem; tackling low productivity, lack of investment and underemployment will. Being a deficit fetishist will just make things worse.

It's a shame Kendall has sold herself as the Blairite candidate. Blairism is dead. It's unforgivable, but perhaps unsurprising considering the years they've spent at the top of the party, that Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were unable to formulate any new vision or narrative for the party to get behind. Kendall is fresher, and does have some interesting, radical ideas. Perhaps her time will come again.

Instead, for better or worse, it looks like we're going to get Jeremy Corbyn. God knows how that will end.
