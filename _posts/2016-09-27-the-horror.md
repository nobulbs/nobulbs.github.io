Traditional explanations for liking horror stories &#8212;

We like a vicarious scare, or we like a controlled scare i.e. one we know won't do us any _real_ harm. Assumption: we don't _really_ want to suffer from the ghost, the horror, what lurks in the darkness.

Horror safely explores our nasty sides. You may like our nasty sides.

Here's another interpretation. What we really want is for all that horror to be true. Why? Because the alternative &#8211; that there's no underlying, organising horror &#8211; is mind-numbling, tediously more terrifying. What horror shows us is a _better world_.

All these organisational impulses are fundamentally nihilistic. Not in the sense that Yog Soggoth wants to destroy everything and will remove all human presence from the world, but in the Nietzschean way of failing to face up to senseless reality.
